Networks are fundamental structures in computer science and mathematics.

## Key Concepts
- [[Graph Theory]] forms the mathematical foundation
- [[Distributed Systems]] apply network principles
- See also [[concepts/~AI#Neural Networks]]

## Applications
- Social network analysis
- Computer networks
- Biological networks
